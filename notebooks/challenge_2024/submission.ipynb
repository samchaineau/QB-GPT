    "Since 2022, generative AI has seen an impressive rise in use, especially in the field of Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. During this year, I explored how we could use the underlying technology to sports analytics, especially football. This work has led me to release the first generative model for football player trajectories : QB-GPT (for Quarterback Generative Pretrained Transformers). \n",
    "\n",
    "QB-GPT is a model using the same technology behing GPT3, called \"Attention\". It is a model trained to predict a team's trajectory on the field at each 0.3 seconds frame. To do so, the model relies a lot on contextual information closely related to the football game : positions, scrimmage line, type of plays and teammates move. I a way, the model is effectively able to guess how a given lineup is expected to move all together by seeing how this team has done by the past. It is both a model that understands the pysics of the game (speed, cuts, rushs...) and the tactical aspects of playbooks. \n",
    "\n",
    "An engine like that can fuel many use cases. I decided to apply the model on the 2024 Big Data Bowl topic and show it can definitely improve coaching by providing an unlimited assistance.\n",

    "In this section, I will explain my approach leading me to this model. Later I will concretely explain the training and generating component of the model. \n",

    "The core hypothesis of QB-GPT is that football is a sequential sports and could be comapred to textual analysis in a way. Games are books. Plays are paragraphs. Players' trajectories are sentences. Players' positions on the field at a given time are words. Those words and sentences (and even paragraphs but I didn't go that far) are not written randomly. It has to make a certain sense which is the tactical spirit of the game. Thus, players move on the pitch according to predefined boundaries and trajectories called \"playcalls\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Starting from this assumption, it is easy to think of a model that generates players' trajectories like GPT generates sentences. The hypothesis is that a model, like a GPT, trained with enough trajectories from enough diverse plays can grasp how a team is expected to move and combine. Then, it can be used to simulate scenarios, predict plays and even recommend trajectories. It is a core engine that compress a lot of football information but needs to have practical use cases to reveal its power. \n",

    "As said earlier, football is like a language for our eyes. Players' movements are words. A GPT-3 model learns to predict the next word by looking at all the previous ones. In our case, there is a trick, a player does not move only depending on his previous movements but also based on the ones from all of his teammates. Hence, QB-GPT predicts the team's movements (as one) based on the team precedent moves. \n",
    "\n",
    "But what is it predicting ? Instead of predicting the x and y coordinates given by the tracking data, QB-GPT predicts a 1 yard squared zone where the player will be. At the beginning of a play it is very likely to be the zone next to his starting point. But after 3-4 seconds, when players are running fast, the next zone can be a bit far away.\n",

    "Predicting tackles or more genrally defensive performance strongly relies on being able to accurately forecast teams' execution for a given play.  Simple use of averages, probabilities or other computed metrics for players or lineups often lack of concrete link with physics of the game. Here is where QB-GPT finds its use case. As QB-GPT is able to generate plays, it is able to represent a very complex distribution of what the play should look like. Drawing several scenarios from this model enables us to explore multiple possibilities as averaging them to obtain an expected play. \n",

On the defensive end, it can propose a player that maximizes the probability of tackling a given player. On the offensive end, it can propose a player who whill be the most likely to avoid tackles. \n",

This is where metrics and other indicators come handy as they can put a new perspective to the generated scenarios by the model. In this notebook, I did not have the time to explore cross checks by adding advanced analytics to produce scenarios that are even closer to the reality. I listed it as the first improvement to do."

Furthermore, you have no clue about the routes of your opponents (only some scenarios from your scouting reports).

The optimization part relies on the ability of the model to change its behavior based on changes in lineups and other elements (play types, scrimmage line...). It can be a powerful tool for coaching staff in order to better select players, scout opponents' playbooks and pick the right play call. This is done by using the generative nature of the model, which enables us to explore possibilites and test hypothesis. "
